Monthly Themes and Purpose of the Blog

<!--more-->

<p>
I plan on having a monthly theme for the blog.
This will help me focus on a specific topic and hopefully provide some
consistency to the main focus of this blog:
Learning and sharing knowledge on quantitative finance and scientific computing.
</p>

<p>
Each theme will be announced at the beginning of the month,
together with more generic training exercises and posts.
</p>

<p>
  These exercises are not to be taken as absolute, may very much contain mistakes
  both in the problem formulation and the solution,
  as I am mostly writing them myself.
  The main goal of these exercises is to provide a starting point for learning and discussion,
  and to motivate further development of tools, both mathematical and computational in nature.
