Quick tutorial on how to use the site:

To navigate the site, use the sidebar on the left. The sidebar contains links to the different sections of the site.
The sidebar works on main pages, and on blog posts the top navbar can be used to access the
[Home]({{ site.baseurl }}), [Archive]({{ site.baseurl }}/archive), and [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) pages.
