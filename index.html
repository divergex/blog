Welcome to my blog—a space to explore ideas in math and algorithms without any pretense.
Here, I'm going to share posts on interesting research papers, intriguing computational problems, and more.
I’m currently considering features like monthly quizzes to keep things interactive.
My goal is to create a friendly, accessible environment where we can all learn and discuss these topics together.

When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ and they are

$$x_1 = {-b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

$$x_2 = {-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \notag$$
